Tired of typing 'go.middlebury.edu/' when you are not on campus? Install the extension below so that you can access your favorite go links, like 'go/portal' when you are at home!

Backstory
---

For years, Middlebury College Library and Information Services has implemented a feature on campus which redirects URI requests with the prefix "go/" to unique URLs defined by individual college community members. This system has become nearly universally adopted for accessing college websites by the community.

Many modern browsers have recently switched to "omnibars" which recognize *go/* URI's as searches rather than requests to the Middlebury system. Furthermore, even when using an old browser, *go/* links are only handled by the Middlebury servers. Thus, the *go/* system is only accessible from outside of the Middlebury local network by using the URL "go.middlebury.edu/". The plugins contained within this repository attempt to remedy both of these problems by redirecting *go/* requests to the appropriate URI.

For those interested, the project source code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/tnbeatty/Middlebury-Go-Fix).

If you are unable to install the plugin or run into any problems, feel free to send me an email at [nate@strabogis.com](mailto:nate@strabogis.com).
