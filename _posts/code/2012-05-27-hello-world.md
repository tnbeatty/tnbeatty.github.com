Welcome to my blog! Hopefully, I will have a chance to post regularly about things which interest me. The topic will mostly be limited to coding - tips and tricks that I discover throughout the course of my work - and the occasional reference to physics or cycling.

I built this website to replace my previous site that I built for a computer science class a while back, [cs.middlebury.edu/~tbeatty](http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~tbeatty/index.php).

I hope you enjoy it!

Best,

Nate
