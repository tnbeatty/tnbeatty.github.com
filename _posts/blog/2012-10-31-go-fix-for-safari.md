Today marks the release of the beta version of a Safari extension that I have been working on. The purpose of the extension is to allow on and off campus access to the Middlebury College 'go/' system. [Download](https://raw.github.com/tnbeatty/Middlebury-Go-Fix/master/Middlebury%20Go%20Fix.safariextz) the extension from the [git repo](https://github.com/tnbeatty/Middlebury-Go-Fix) and install it. It auto-updates to the latest version and should allow you full access to *go/* links from anywhere. View the [project](/projects/2012/10/27/go-for-safari.html) for more details.
