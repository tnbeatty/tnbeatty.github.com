Welcome to my blog! Hopefully, I will have a chance to post regularly about things which interest me. The topic will mostly be limited to coding - tips and tricks that I discover throughout the course of my work - and the occasional reference to physics or cycling.

I built this website to replace my previous site, [natebeatty.com](http://natebeatty.com).

I hope you enjoy it!

Best,

Nate
