While I was riding my bike today, I got thinking (as I am wont to) about physics. Usually I take the time on my bike to clear my mind of my current work, although today's particular sequence of thoughts was definitely related to light.

I have recently been listening to a lot of [Startalk Radio](http://www.startalkradio.net) episodes during which [Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/) has many times raised the subject of getting a human (or many) to Mars. According to him, radiation from the sun is a major hurdle in the way of human interplanetary space travel. Although we can get robots to Mars, humans do not respond well to high levels of radiation. Engineers have yet to develop a shielding apparatus light enough to be transported into space and efficient enough to protect delicate cargo consisting of a group of astronauts. Major Tom would arrive on Mars with quite the sunburn if he were exposed to the sun's rays for the many-month flight to the Red Planet.

That got me thinking... How long would it take to get a sunburn in space? I am only kind of kidding. On my bike, I considered calculating how long it would take the surface area of my body to absorb as much radiation as it would in one hour in the summer sun on Earth if it were placed in outer space half way between the earth and the moon. Without running any numbers, I can safely say that the time is short... I have no doubt that I would make the deepest fried chicken nugget look downright soggy in well under a minute. Without a protective atmosphere above them, Astronauts must be shielded from this radiation when they are in space, right?

I will need to do some more research about the specifics, but I know that the International Space Station is in low-earth orbit. It is not actually all that far away from the earth and is not subjected to the same extremes that a spacecraft traveling from here to the moon would be. The following is speculation, but the earth might somewhat protect a craft in low-earth orbit from at least a bit of the harmful rays of the sun. That being said, my sunburn from skiing at and "altitude" of under 12,000 feet at Alta, Utah a couple of years ago - well below low-earth orbit - got pretty severe pretty quickly. I would wager that Astronauts in the ISS need to be protected from the sun or limit their direct exposure.

I have heard multiple astronauts say that they spend a lot of their free time looking (and taking pictures) out of the windows while aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

Sure, glass (not to mention other materials) can be polarized, tinted, etc., to filter out harmful light wavelengths and allow a lower intensity of visible light to pass through. However, if the surfaces of the window were not parallel, the view of the earth would be distorted. Similarly, if the glass were tinted, someone looking at the earth through the window would not see colors as they would appear unfiltered. Think of how the world looks behind the lenses of your sunglasses - no matter how good (or expensive) they are, they're not perfect. Distortion and clarity (or lack thereof) are challenges that lens designers constantly face.

So what are the windows like on the ISS? How close has an astronaut come to ever seeing the earth as it would be seen with the "naked eye." By this, I mean: How little distortion to the image caused by the ISS windows, physical distortion and distortion of the colors in the visible spectrum, are engineers able to eliminate while still adequately protecting the people inside the station?

Off to the Internet! The opportunities for physics research never end.

These days, most of the work that humans do in space happens aboard the International Space Station, which happens to also be a [US National Laboratory](http://www.iss-casis.org/About/AboutISSNationalLab.aspx). Thus, a lot of viewing of the earth through windows occurs aboard the lab. I narrowed the scope of my reading to ISS components.

Perhaps the most striking set of windows aboard the ISS are in the Cupola Observational Module. Built in 2004 by a [collaboration of European contractors](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/International_Space_Station/ESA_transfer_ownership_of_European-built_ISS_observation_module_to_NASA), the cupola is a room almost [ten feet in diameter](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/cupola.html) from which astronauts can visually monitor and control robotic operations (the [Space Station Remote Manipulator System](http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/iss/mss_ssrms.asp)) on the outside of the station (or earthgaze). The technical lingo for these outside operations is apparently [EVA](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/International_Space_Station/Largest_window_for_space_completed), or "Extra Vehicular Activities". Six side windows in a hexagonal arrangement and one large window on the top of the unit provide a 360 degree view.

The circular center window is the [largest ever to be used in space](http://www.thalesaleniaspace-issmodules.com/cupola). 

Normally, the view through the windows is of decent quality, but not perfect. All of the windows have external scratch panes as well as shutters (operable from within the lab) to protect them from impact. These panes are marred from occasional micrometeorite strikes and are occasionally removed. Without the scratch panes, the windows are "optical quality." They have only been used a handful of times in this configuration.

The other window of particular note aboard the ISS is the Destiny window. It is the only other optical quality window aboard the ISS and transmits [98.5%](http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2002/29may_lookingglass/) of incident visible light. WORF, the Window Observational Research Facility, is the name of the housing that sits over the interior of the window and contains the support systems for a myriad of scientific equipment, including sensors and cameras, that can be positioned in front of the Destiny window. The first installment of [NASA's ISS WORF video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc82Pl_fcsk) gives a very good overview of the technology.

The optical clarity of the window is high in the visible and near IR spectra, although it must filter out other wavelengths of light. My search for this information continues and I will update this post if I discover the answer to my initial question about protecting from the sun's harmful rays in space.
