abstract: A tech startup with a geography problem. Every day is a journey.

I started Strabo, LLC with [Will Potter](http://willpots.com) in April 2011 after Jeff Howarth, Professor of Geography at Middlebury College and Chester Harvey, former geography faculty, approached us about developing an iPhone application for collecting and processing GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data. After developing the technology over the course of the summer of 2011, Parker Woodworth (Middlebury College '13.5) joined the team to help with product development. We continued to work on a product for academics and geography professionals throughout the summer.

In January 2011, after exploring several potential markets and models, the Strabo team decided to develop a social product. We coded and designed furiously and produced a product currently undergoing extensive beta testing.

We are continuing to design and develop this summer and are making good progress on another social product which uses the core technology that we engineered in 2011.
