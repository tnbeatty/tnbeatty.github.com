This is the future homepage for my Middlebury dining menu application. Right now, I have a preliminary design and plan on starting the programming of the app over the next week.

The application consists of one main view. On the iPhone, three tabs at the top allow the user to select a dining hall and the main screen below shows the menu for the next available meal. The user can flip the page to view the menu for the next or previous meal. On the iPad, all three dining hall menus are displayed simultaneously. Meals are cached a number of days in advance, so whether you are online or offline, sitting in a WIFI classroom, or walking across the beach reading your iPad, you will always be able to browse the menu - no waiting for Portal pages to load.

If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please let me know. Fire me an email at [nate@strabogis.com](mailto:nate@strabogis.com). Thanks for your help! I'll provide updates on my site and posts to my blog as I make more progress and eventually submit the app to the Apple app store.
