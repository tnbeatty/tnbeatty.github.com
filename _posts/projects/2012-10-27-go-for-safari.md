abstract: An extension to enable access to the Middlebury College 'go/' system in the Safari 6 omni-box.
---

For years, Middlebury College Library and Information Services has implemented a feature on campus which redirects URI requests with the prefix "go/" to unique URL's defined by individual college community members. This system has become nearly universally adopted for accessing college websites by the community.

Many modern browsers have recently switched to "omnibars" which recognize *go/* URI's as searches rather than requests to the Middlebury system. Furthermore, even when using an old browser, *go/* links are only handled by the Middlebury servers. Thus, the *go/* system is only accessible from outside of the Middlebury local network by using the URL "go.middlebury.edu/". The plugins contained within this repository attempt to remedy both of these problems by redirecting *go/* requests to the appropriate URI.

For those interested, the project source code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/tnbeatty/Middlebury-Go-Fix).

Also, *go/* links are accessible from any computer using the search box on my [Farmstand](http://middfarmstand.heroku.com) site, which is still in alpha.
