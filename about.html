	<h2>Hi!</h2>
	<p>My name is Nate. I am a physics major at Middlebury College, a programmer, an entrepreneur, and a cyclist. I like developing for both web and iOS and have been working recently on a company called <a href="http://strabogis.com">Strabo</a>. Please feel free to get in touch by sending me an <a href="mailto:nate@strabogis.com">email</a>.</p>

	<h2>This Site</h2>
	<p>I built this site using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a> to replace my old personal website. I hope to maintain my blog and update my site as frequently as possible. A lot of my posts will include some code - feel free to use any of it as you wish. In the spirit of <a href="http://paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>, I don't care about attribution, bro - It's all yours. On that same note, all of the code for this site is available on <a href="https://github.com/tnbeatty/tnbeatty.github.com">github</a>.<p>

	<h2>Freelance Work</h2>
	<p>Lets assume for a minute that you have checked out my projects and like some of <a href="/projects.html">my work</a>. In this extremely hypothetical and improbable situation, you might want to contact me about building your website or iPhone application. Maybe you would want me to do some consulting. In either case, you could let me know via email or by giving me a call. I would be happy to discuss your latest project with you.</p>
