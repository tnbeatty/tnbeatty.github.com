<h4 class="subheader">a bit more about me</h4>

<p>My name is Nate Beatty, but you already know that because you are currently visiting <a href="/">natebeatty.com</a>. I am currently a physics major (and a math minor) at <a href="http://middlebury.edu">Middlebury College</a> in Vermont. When I am not working on problem sets, I enjoy programming, and spending time outside. Middlebury is located in one of the most beautiful places on the planet, and I am lucky to have spent four years enjoying all that the local geography has to offer by hiking, biking, and running during study breaks.</p>

<p>During my Sophomore year at Middlebury, after learning Objective-C and Apple's iOS SDK, I started an LLC called <a href="http://strabogis.com">Strabo</a> with <a href="http://willpots.com">Will Potter</a> and <a href="http://parkerwoodworth.com">Parker Woodworth</a>. We partnered with <a href="http://greenmtd.com">Green Mountain Digital</a>, also known as NatureShare, during the summer of 2012. While working with Strabo in their Woodstock, Vermont offices, I fine-tuned my programming skills and learned a lot about both computers and people - it was a great experience and an incredible opportunity to work with the talented folks who created <a href="http://yonder.it">Yonder</a>.</p>

<p>Although I am focusing back on Physics these days, I put my programming skills to good use by doing some freelance work. If you have an idea or a project that you would like to discuss, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to get in touch by sending me an email <a href="mailto:nate.beatty@gmail.com">nate.beatty@gmail.com</a></p>
